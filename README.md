# Excel-game
In this fun and creative project, I combined Python and Excel to showcase an animation inside an Excel sheet! Using Python, I pixelated an image and filled Excel cells with their corresponding RGB colors, perfectly aligned to recreate the image. The result? A unique New Year greeting brought to life through code and Excel magic
